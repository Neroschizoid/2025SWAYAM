/*
Logic:
- Treat each grid cell as a graph node.
- Whenever an unvisited '1' (land) is found, start DFS to mark the full island as visited.
- Each new DFS call corresponds to one new island.
Time complexity: O(R*C)

This is a classic grid-based graph problem similar to finding connected components.
Each "1" (land) represents a node, and adjacent (up, down, left, right) land cells form one island.
