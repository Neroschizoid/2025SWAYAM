/*
Logic: Make amount using minimum number of coins
1. Sort coins in descending order
2. For each coin denomination:
   - Use as many coins as possible
   - Update remaining amount
3. Continue until amount becomes 0

Why Greedy Works (for standard coin systems):
- Larger denominations are always optimal to use first
- Each coin is multiple of smaller ones
- No combination of smaller coins is better than larger coin

Note: This greedy approach works only for canonical coin systems
(like US/Indian currency). For arbitrary coin values, dynamic
programming should be used.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for coin selection
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding input array
