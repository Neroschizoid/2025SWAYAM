/*
Logic: Maximum number of non-overlapping activities
1. Sort all activities by finish time
2. Select first activity (earliest finish)
3. For remaining activities:
   - If start time >= last selected activity's finish time
   - Select it and update last finish time
4. Return count of selected activities

Why Greedy Works:
- Sorting by finish time ensures we always have maximum time for remaining activities
- Each selection is locally optimal (earliest finish)
- Local optimal choices lead to global optimal solution

Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding input array
