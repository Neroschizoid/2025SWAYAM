/*
Logic:
- Expands nodes in order of increasing distance from the source.
- Updates neighbor distances whenever a shorter path is found.
- No negative edge weights allowed.
Time Complexity: O(E log V)

Algorithm Steps:
1. Set distance of the source to 0, all others to infinity.
2. Use a min-heap to always expand the node with smallest current distance.
3. For each neighbor, update its distance if a shorter path is found.
4. Once a node's shortest distance is finalized (popped from heap), it isn't updated again.

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest distance from a source node to all other nodes 
in a weighted graph (directed or undirected), as long as all edge weights are non-negative.
It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to greedily select the next node with the minimum distance.
